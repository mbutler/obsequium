## What this is

This folder demonstrates how to keep a standalone site scoped to its own data and navigation. You can remove the entire `demo-project` folder without affecting other sites.

## Next steps

- Add more pages under `src/demo-project/`
- Update `demo-project.json` for the site brand and navigation
- Delete this folder when you no longer need the example
